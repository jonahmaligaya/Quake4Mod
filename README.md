This mod allows you to capture 5 different new "Pals" using your "Palcatcher." The Gladiator, the Light Tank, the Iron Maiden, the Stream Protector, and the Sentry are among the Pals you can now capture and deploy.
Upon capture of these "Pals," you will receive a primary, secondary, and tertiary attack, because in Palworld, each Pal gets the ability to use three different attacks. There are other attacks you can use, but they
are performed simply by a Pal targetting an enemy.
